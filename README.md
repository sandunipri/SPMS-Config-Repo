# Smart Parking System â€“ Config Repository

This is the centralized configuration repository for the **Smart Parking Management System**, designed to manage and serve externalized configuration properties to all microservices through the **Spring Cloud Config Server**.

Each configuration file is written in YAML format and maps to a corresponding microservice. The Config Server reads these files and delivers the configuration dynamically to services at runtime.
